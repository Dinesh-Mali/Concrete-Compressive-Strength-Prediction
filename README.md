# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction
We are predicting concrete compressive strength using keras and Auto Keras - AutoML.

# Introduction
Main aim of the project is to predict the correct concrete compressive strength using Machine Learning Techniques and Auto ML.

# Motivation
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonliniear 
function of age and ingredients.
We will try to predict the different cement comressive strengths with the help of the ingrediants information given to us.

We will use Keras Sequential model to predict the strength, then we will see how we can implement the same using Auto Keras, which is an Auto ML Library.

# Auto Keras
An AutoML system based on keras.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
